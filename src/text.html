                <h1>Ehvam</h1>
                <h3>International Spiritual Center for Peace</h3>

                <p>Ehvam is envisioned as a regional and international advanced spiritual center for peace.
                    It will take form on a unique desert hill top, near the ancient city of Moa in the Arava Region, on the path of the historic Incense Route. Its location is close to the Jordanian and Israeli Border, at the heart of one of the most disruptive conflict zones in the world – the Middle East.
